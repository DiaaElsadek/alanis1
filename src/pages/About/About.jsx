              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                HomeCare Connect was founded in 2020 when our CEO, Ahmed, struggled to find 
                quality care for his aging parents. Frustrated with the lack of transparent, 
                reliable options in the market, he assembled a team of healthcare and technology 
                experts to create a better solution.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, we've helped thousands of families find trusted caregivers for their 
                loved ones, and provided hundreds of care professionals with opportunities to 
                grow their careers while doing meaningful work.
